👋🏻👋🏻
Hi, I’m Niccolò, I'm 21 years old and I’m currently learning Computer Science at the University of Turin. 🧑🏻‍💻
I've been programming and learning for 2 years, focusing on building a strong foundation in computer science principles, mainly in software development. 💻
During my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience with various programming languages like Python, Java, and C, as well as formal programming structure like Finate State Automatons. 
I’m also expanding my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, computer architecture and databases. ⌨️

In addition to my academic work, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects and developing personal projects that challenge me to grow as a programmer. I particularly love solving problems and constantly push myself to learn new tools and technologies in order to gain new skills. 🎮

Feel free to check out my repositories and follow my journey as I continue to explore and build in the world of programming. Let’s connect and collaborate on some exciting projects! 🏔
I'm keen on discussing about different ways to improve my projects and programming skills, which is why I'm lookin forward to hearing your advice! 💡
